        <h2>Course Description</h2>
        <p>This course will introduce students to usability design concepts and authentic test methods for interactive media. Usability is grounded in tailoring interface design for the most effective user experience. Students will design, conduct and analyze usability tests based on established principles, research findings and theory. Upon completion of this course, students will be able to develop a usability test plan, recruit appropriate users, create robust task scenarios, facilitate testing, and analyze and communicate the test results.</p>

<h3>Usability Quiz Questions</h3>

<p>Read <em>Ch. 2:&nbsp; What is Usability Testing?</em> The following resources provide examples of potential quiz questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.humanfactors.com/about/webquiz.asp">Human Factors International</a></li>
<li><a href="http://facweb.cs.depaul.edu/cmiller/hci460/midterm.doc">DePaul University &mdash; Evaluating Human Computer Interaction</a></li>
<li>Additional Questions (source: <a href="http://www.cs.utep.edu/nigel/hci/test2-08.pdf">http://www.cs.utep.edu/nigel/hci/test2-08.pdf</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.utep.edu/nigel/hci/test2-08.pdf">http://www.cs.utep.edu/nigel/hci/test2-08.pdf</a>)<ul>
<li>Give two reasons why you may wish to use a low-fidelity prototype instead of a high-fidelity one.</li> 
<li>What are cognitive walkthroughs good for?</li>
<li>Identify 3 things wrong with the following error message: <em>&#8220;You have entered an invalid string character in Field 123A.&#8221;</em></li>
<li>Some textbooks on usability engineering include &#8220;survey&#8221; as a usability method. For example, you could simply mail a list of questions about some software to a population of users. This has various advantages, but also some disadvantages. List two kinds of information about an interface which typically cannot be obtained by a survey, and for each, explain what other usability method would be able to obtain that information.</li>
<li>What sorts of potential usability problems would a heuristic evaluation be unable to detect?</li></ul></li>
</ul>

<h3>Case Study Evaluation</h3>

<p>Read <em>Ch. 3: When Should You Test?</em> The following resources provide examples of case studies to be used during discussion and evaluation of usability testing methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://ucs.ist.psu.edu/default.asp?button=2">Usability Case Crawler</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.usabilityfirst.com/roi/studies.txl">Usability ROI: Case Studies</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>Test Plan Statement of Work (SOW)</h3>
<p>Read <em>Ch. 3:&nbsp; When Should You Test?</em> Student will evaluate a site, product, or interface they would like to conduct usability testing on. Once the site, product, or interface is identified, the students must build a justification for testing the site, identify the goals and objectives for conducting the test, and identify the methods used to conduct the evaluation.</p>

<h3>Recruitment Screener</h3>
<p>Read <em>Ch. 7: Find and Select Participants</em>. The primary goal of the recruitment screen assignment is to develop the screener and scheduling approach for participants. Students will identify the audience targeted for the study; preferred method for recruiting; develop a list of questions and screening script used to filter participants who are not appropriate for the study; and develop materials for scheduling participants (i.e. scheduling email, reminder call script, method for ensuring a variety of demographic needs are reflected in the participant pool).</p>

<h3>Usability Lab</h3>

<p>Read <em>Ch. 4:&nbsp; Skills for Test Moderators, Ch. 9:&nbsp; Conduct Test Sessions, Ch. 10:&nbsp; Debrief Participants and Observers.</em> Conduct at least 4 usability test sessions with each user group of at least 30 minutes each. Take notes about your experiences during the usability session because you will be writing a few paragraphs about your experiences. Post-lab, identify ways that the session could be improved to create a better test for the users and/or moderators.</p>

<h4>For all usability sessions:</h4>

<p>Include the following information in your lab report.</p>

<ul>
<li>Describe the usability test plan you completed.</li>
<li>Copy and paste the URL of the web site you tested within your lab report.</li>
<li>Write a few paragraphs about your experiences using the simulation. Describe any surprises encountered or frustrations that felt&#8212;from the user and/or moderator perspective.</li>
<li>Suggest three ways that the usability test design could be improved.</li>

<h3>Data Summary Memo</h3>

<p>Read <em>Ch. 11:&nbsp; Analyze Data &amp; Observations and Ch. 14:&nbsp; Expanding from Usability Testing to Designing User Experience.</em> The point of this activity is to write a preliminary summary of raw data collected in the previous usability lab. Data Summary Memo required components:</p>

<ol>
<li>purpose/introduction</li>
<li>test users profile (# of participants, basic demographic information, technology competency, etc. Any information collected prior to test)</li>
<li>definition of anticipated raw data (what was collected, and how)</li>
<li>summary of raw results (use tables and graphs wherever possible)</li>
<li>early insights (illustrate patterns, trends, outliers, etc. citing tables/graphs)</li>

<h3>Usability Report</h3>

<h4>Write a Usability Report</h4>

<p>Read <em>Ch. 12:&nbsp; Report Findings and Recommendations and Ch. 14:&nbsp; Expanding from Usability Testing to Designing User Experience.</em> Create a Usability Report for the activity and data you described in the Usability Lab and Data Summary Memo. The Usability Report should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction/overview of project</li>
<li>Data Summary Memo</li>
<li>Hierarchy of Findings (distinguish findings that have the most impact)</li>
<li>Recommendations (describe findings into actionable recommendations)</li>
<li>Future Research (identify areas where further research is required)</li>
<li>Conclusion</li>

<h3>Brief paper</h3>

<p>Read <em>Ch. 13: Variations on Basic Method.</em> The Brief Paper is a 2&ndash;3 page written critique with a brief description of a (usability test) technique variation, and how it would have worked/not worked for your previous usability exercise.</p>

<p>Take into account the proposed user audience for the site, test parameters/constraints, test session and findings, etc. (in other words, the topics we discussed in class) and make an attempt to justify why the technique would have worked for your usability exercise conducted in class&#8212;or not.</p><p> </p>

<p>Include the following information in your Brief Paper.</p>

<ul>
<li>Describe the variation of usability technique you selected.</li>
<li>Compare and contrast this new technique with the technique you used for class.</li>
<li>Justify why the variation why the new technique would have worked well for you&mdash;or not.</li>

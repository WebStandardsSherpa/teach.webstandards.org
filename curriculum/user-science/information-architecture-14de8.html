<h4 id="lab1">Web Project Definition</h4>
  <p>The point of this activity is to define the purpose, audience, value, desired perception, technical and user needs for a new web site. In teams of two, select a web site topic below:</p>
<ul>
  <li>eText books for college students</li>
  <li>a text/email alert service for sports to let you know when a game is getting really good</li>
  <li>a fresh baked cookie delivery service </li>
  <li>an online dating service</li>
  <li>or suggest a topic for your web site</li>
</ul>
<p>One member of your team will play the role of the information architect. The other member of your team will play the client who wants the new website.</p>
<p>Conduct a client interview using the <a href="http://teach.webstandards.org/images/uploads/documents/US200_clientsurvey.doc">client survey</a>. Summarize your findings and write a one page project brief.  Consider using Kelly Goto's <a href="http://www.web-redesign.com/downloads/03_communication-brief_wksht.pdf">Communication Brief Worksheet</a> as a guide.  Content Brief required components:
</p><ol>  
<li>purpose
</li><li>audience definition
</li><li>value to audience
</li><li>desired perception
</li><li>technical and user needs
</li></ol>

<h4 id="lab3">Create a Content Inventory and Content Map</h4>
<p>Conduct a content audit and inventory on a small local restaurant or club's web site. In order to keep this assignment to a reasonable size, it is suggested that you not use a national chain or any site that has more than 30 pages.</p>
<p>Use the
<a href="http://teach.webstandards.org/images/uploads/documents/US200_simplecontentaudit.xls">simple content audit spreadsheet</a>
(a simplified version of the content inventory spreadsheet developed by Sarah Rice of Senab Consulting) to document your content audit. The content inventory should include at least 15 pages on the site. Each page should have a unique page id number. Use the content inventory examples from Chapter 12.5 in
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Information-Architecture-World-Wide-Web/dp/0596527349/">Information Architecture for the World Wide Web, 3rd Edition,</a> as your guide.</p>
<p>Using paper and pencil, create a simple content map diagram based on the content inventory. Use the page titles and unique page id numbers from the content inventory to label each page on the content map.</p>

<h4 id="lab8">Develop Functional Specifications and a Working Prototype</h4>
<p>Imagine that you are an information architect in a web design firm. A museum has hired your firm to help them create a web application for exhibit planning. The museum director has explained that they web application should be designed to help them create exhibits that appeal to the general public. The primary users will be curators. The curators will need to browse the museum's collection, find works of art belonging to a number of themes and build a story around them.</p>
<p>For this assignment focus on the part of the application that will allow the curators to browse the collection, indicate works of art that might be used in the exhibit, as well as indicate themes/stories related to individual works of art.</p>
<p>Decide on the desired functionality. Document the desired functionality and prioritize is into the following categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Required functionality</li>
<li>Preferred functionality</li>
<li>Bonus functionality</li>
</ol>
<p>For the items you have listed in required functionality, develop a simple xhtml/css functional prototype that will allow your client to click through and experience the bare bones interactive elements.</p>

<h3 id="paper">IA Critique Paper</h3>
<p> The IA critique is a five page written critique with accompanying &#8220;before&#8221; and &#8220;after&#8221; screenshots of the Web page(s) critiqued from a Web site approved by the instructor. </p>
<p> You may choose to do an IA critique of the one of these four pages: </p>
<ul>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>craigslist</li>
<li>Myspace</li>
<li>Facebook</li>
<li>Your School/College/University</li>
</ul>
<p> Critiques include a screen shot of the current home page, and a screen shot of your new design with commentary on why you are making changes to the design. Take into account the proposed user audience for the site, accessibility, labeling, navigation, etc. (in other words, the topics we discuss in class) and make an attempt to improve on these current designs. </p>
<p>Ideal formatting would be five pages of text describing your changes and why you made them, and a &#8220;before&#8221; and an &#8220;after&#8221; picture. Also, send an email to the class list so others can learn from your ideas. </p>
<p> Digital designs are required (no sketches of design). Two main methods for preparing your proposed design: </p>
<ol>
<li>Download the<acronym title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</acronym> and graphics for the page and modify the source code yourself and add (or resize) any relevant new graphics you require for your design.</li>
<li>Take a screen shot of the page and use a graphics editing program to &#8220;paint over&#8221; your proposed re&#8211;design.</li>
</ol>
<p>Divide your new design into some kind of quadrants or use arrows with numbers (or something like that) to note the sections you&#8217;re discussing in the textual part of the design critique. </p>
<p> Focus more on how the individual page (the Home page, what you&#8217;re critiquing) should work and then what a good IA would do to try to make those concepts and designs flow into the other pages. </p>

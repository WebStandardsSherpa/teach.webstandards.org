<h3>Reading Assignments</h3>

<p>Aside from the readings noted in each lab, the following readings will provide background relevant to essay and discussion questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>Chapters 2, 4, and 12 of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Project-Guide-Design-experience-designers/dp/0321607376/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1248882455&amp;sr=8-1">A Project Guide to UX Design: for User Experience Designers in the Field or in the Making</a></li>
<li>Chapters 2 and 3 of Dan Saffer&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Designing-Interaction-Creating-Innovative-Applications/dp/0321643399/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1248882372&amp;sr=8-1">Designing for Interaction: Creating Smart Applications and Clever Devices</a>.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Labs</h3>

<h4>Lab 1 - Determine the business purpose of a new Web site</h4>

<p>The point of this activity is to define the purpose, audience, value, desired perception, technical and user needs for a new web site. In teams of two, select a web site topic below:</p>

<ul>
<li>eText books for college students</li>
<li>a text/email alert service for sports to let you know when a game is getting really good</li>
<li>a fresh baked cookie delivery service</li>
<li>an online dating service</li>
</ul>

<p>One member of your team will play the role of the interaction designer. The other member of your team will play the client who wants the new Web site.</p>

<p>Review the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>&#8220;A Project Guide to UX Design&#8221;, pages 56&ndash;66</li>
<li>Kelly Goto&#8217;s <a href="http://www.web-redesign.com/downloads/03_communication-brief_wksht.pdf">Communication Brief Worksheet</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Conduct a client interview using the <a href="http://teach.webstandards.org/images/uploads/documents/clientsurvey.doc">client survey</a>. Summarize your findings and write a one page project brief. Project Brief required components:</p>

<ol>
<li>purpose &amp; business objectives</li>
<li>audience definition</li>
<li>value to audience</li>
<li>desired perception</li>
<li>technical and user needs</li>
</ol>

<h4>Lab 2 - Define the primary audiences</h4>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;A Project Guide to UX Design&#8221; pages 112&ndash;125</li>
<li>The article, <a href="http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/building-a-data">Building a Data Backed Persona</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Look back at the client survey and project brief you completed in Lab 1 and develop 3 personas representing different user types within the primary audience. Use the persona template to bring an imaginary audience member to life by filing in the following details:</p>

<ul>
<li>photo</li>
<li>name</li>
<li>quote</li>
<li>description</li>
<li>demographics</li>
<li>technical profile</li>
<li>top three user goals</li>
</ul>

<p>Discuss whether or not these different personas may interact with each other on the site, and how they would do so.</p>

<td>The assignment is incomplete, or the personas created do not accurately represent the target audience previously defined.</td>
<td>The personas created fit the target audience, but the rationale behind representing these three personas is not clear (for example, the personas seem fairly similar to each other)</td>
<td>The personas are clear and represent the target audience well, but the description of how they relate to each other (or interact with each other) is not fully explored.</td>
<td>The personas are clear and their relationship to each other on the site (or in the larger context) is well-reasoned and well-written.</td>

<h4>Lab 3 part 1 - Conduct a heuristic analysis of an existing site</h4>

<p>The point of this activity is to build skills in evaluation of a site according to common usability guidelines (also known as &#8220;heuristics&#8221;). The most commonly referenced set of heuristics are those made known by Jakob Nielsen. These two articles provide those heuristics and details on conducting an analysis:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_evaluation.html">How to cConduct a Heuristic Evaluation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">List of 10 Usability Heuristics</a></li>
</ul>

<p>To the instructor: Select an existing web site that can be easily accessed (no registration required for most areas). Provide students with the following focus:</p>

<ul>
<li>The URL to be analyzed</li>
<li>The primary audience of focus (for example, parents of young children, for a parenting advice site)</li>
<li>3&ndash;4 scenarios that should be considered (for example, finding an answer to a medical question, finding a pediatrician in the area, signing up for a newsletter)</li>
</ul>

<p>To the students: Conduct a heuristic analysis using Jakob Nielsen&#8217;s <a href="http://www.useit.com/papers/heuristic/heuristic_list.html">10 usability heuristics</a>. Note at least 10 findings and discuss the usability impact of each. Once you are done, share your findings with the rest of the class and note the degree to which findings overlap from student to student.</p>

<h4>Lab 3 part 2 - Identify Design Patterns</h4>

<p>Read chapters 1 and 2 of Jenifer Tidwell&#8217;s book, &#8220;Designing Interfaces,&#8221; to get an understanding of design patterns and how they are used. Identify at least 4 design patterns being used in the site from your heuristic, and describe how the sites design follows each pattern (patterns can come from anywhere in Tidewell&#8217;s book, not just the first two chapters &mdash; students can also see much of the information online at <a href="http://designinginterfaces.com/">the Designing Interfaces (Web site)</a>. Discuss the specific design for each that was chosen within the site, and whether or not you think there was a better alternative to solving that particular design problem.</p>

<h4>Lab 4 - Define 10 Key Tasks</h4>

<p>For the instructor: For this lab, 1-3 different project briefs for a project that can easily include field observations as part of the design exploration (depending on course length this could be an exercise you give to the class; see the Project Brief activity above for input). For example, an information kiosk at a museum, a concierge service in a hotel lobby, a self-serve kiosk at a fast food restaurant, or a student&#8217;s dashboard in a computer lab could all allow for observations as part of persona development. Students will use this information to outline key tasks.</p>

<p>For students: Using the materials provided, create a short persona for the site (1&ndash;2 paragraphs, text only) and outline 10 tasks that the persona may perform on the site. If possible, go to a relevant location and observe the people, context, and activities there as an input to this.</p>

<p>Tasks should be multi-step (around 2&ndash;5 steps) but specific, leading to a definite conclusion. For example, the task &#8220;research information on exhibits&#8221; would be too vague. Some good examples are:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Find the restrooms using an interactive map&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Choose which toy to include in the kid&#8217;s meal&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;Post a question to a class discussion&#8221;</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lab 5 - Create Storyboards</h4>

<p>Read pages 147&ndash;150 of &#8220;A Project Guide to UX Design&#8221; on the process of Storyboarding. Choose 2 tasks from the list above and create storyboards that represent the user&#8217;s initial need, the thought process that leads the user to the site, his/her experience when using the site, and the result.</p>

<h4>Lab 6 - Write a Functional Spec</h4>

<p>Continuing with the concept created in Labs 4 and 5, write a short functional spec representing the major features to be included in the project. Each major item should have a heading, a short descriptive paragraph as to the purpose, and related tasks. For example:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Heading:</strong> Class Discussions</li>
<li><strong>Description:</strong> Discussion boards will be provided for students to discuss topics posted by the instructor, and to ask clarifying questions of other students</li>
<li><strong>Tasks:</strong> Post a new conversational topic, post a reply, search for a topic</li>
</ul>

<p>Document the desired functionality and prioritize each item into the following categories:</p>

<ol>
<li>Required functionality</li>
<li>Preferred functionality</li>
<li>Bonus functionality</li>
</ol>

<h4>Lab 7 - Create Interaction Designs</h4>

<p>Read chapters 10 and 11 of &#8220;A Project Guide to UX Design&#8221; covering site maps, task flows, and wireframes.</p>

<p>Create a site map representing the navigational areas of the site. Be sure to include a framework that accounts for all required functionality.</p>

<p>Choose 1 feature from the functional spec and create tasks flows for each of the tasks within them. Then, create a series of wireframes (6&ndash;8) that represent the full flow for that feature, from starting point to finish. Use notes to indicate any behavior within the page that may not be clear, and to indicate how a user would move from one page to the next.</p>

<h4>Lab 8 - Communicate the Design</h4>

<p>To the instructor: A key factor in the success of an interaction designer is to demonstrate an ability to clearly communicate their interaction designs, and the surrounding context of use, to different people on the project team. For this lab, once you&#8217;ve given direct feedback on the results of Lab 7 and allowed time for any adjustments, pair up two students and have them each describe their solution to the other using any materials that were inputs or outputs from the previous lab. Once both have had equal time to explain and ask questions(15 minutes each), have them fill out and submit a questionnaire that asks the following of their partner&#8217;s work, without having the materials in front of them:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is the main purpose of the site?</li>
<li>Describe a typical user.</li>
<li>Describe one of the tasks included. What need is driving that user to complete that task?</li>
<li>How does this design support them through the task?</li>
</ul>

<h4>Lab 9 - Evaluate Prototyping Tools</h4>

<p>Choose 3 prototyping tools that you have access to. Possible prototyping tools include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Omnigraffle</li>
<li>Microsoft Visio</li>
<li>Adobe Flash</li>
<li>Balsamiq Mockups</li>
<li>iPlotz</li>
<li>Adobe Fireworks</li>
<li>Adobe InDesign</li>
<li>Microsoft Sketchflow</li>
</ul>

<p>Choose one of the flows you created in a previous lab (ideally one with no more than 3 steps). Recreate that flow in each of the 3 tools. Then, provide an evaluation of each tool along the following lines:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overall ease of use</li>
<li>Strengths</li>
<li>Weaknesses</li>
<li>The types of projects, or points in the process, that would benefit most from this tool</li>
</ul><p> </p>

<h4>Final - Build a Prototype</h4>

<p>To the instructor: have each student spend 5&ndash;10 minutes describing their materials from Labs 7 &amp; 8 to the rest of the class. Then, allow each student to pick another student&#8217;s work from which to create a light prototype (multiple students should be able to select the same student&#8217;s work, as long as it is not their own. You may want to assign extra credit to a student with very popular work if you consider it a sign they&#8217;ve chosen an engaging topic, or included great ideas and detail).</p>

<p>To the student: Choose the work of one of your fellow students, and use it to create a prototype based on the tasks they outlined in previous labs. Pick your tool based on your previous review of prototyping tools. Feel free to collaborate with the creator of the materials if you have questions or ideas during prototype creation (note, if the creator&#8217;s materials are being used by multiple students, be sure to be respectful of that person&#8217;s time and consider a group meeting). Add additional ideas/details if you think they add to the user&#8217;s experience.</p>

<p>Then, present your prototype to the class via a live demo.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Approaches to Interaction Design</strong>. Of the four approaches covered in the readings from &#8220;Designing for Interaction&#8221; - user-centered design, activity-centered design, systems design, and genius design - which approach would you prefer to follow, and why? Which one might you pick if working with a large project team where there are several designers? Are there other factors that may affect your choice of approach?</li>
<li><strong>Methods for Site Analysis</strong>. Discuss how usability testing or task analysis can provide information on an existing product. When might you use each method? For a brand new site (where no current version exists to be tested), how might you gather information before design begins?</li>
<li><strong>Design Stages</strong>. Discuss the difference between conceptual and detailed design. Do you think it&#8217;s important to differentiate between these two stages? Why or why not? If you did separate them, what would you do differently in each stage?</li>
<li><strong>Prototyping</strong>. Discuss the pros and cons of the following types of prototypes; paper, sketch interactive, high-fidelity without full functionality, high-fidelity with full functionality</li>

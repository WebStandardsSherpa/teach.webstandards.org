        <h2>Assignments</h2>
        <h3>Application Concept Recommendations</h3>
<p>In this course you will be designing a series of prototypes for hypothetical web applications. The below list of  application concepts are simply ideas to get you thinking about the type of application you would like to prototype. Be sure to discuss your application concept with your instructor before beginning an assignment.</p>
<ul>
<li>Online email client</li>
<li>Online music sharing tool</li>
<li>iPhone application</li>
<li>Photo management and sharing application</li>
<li>Social networking identity aggregator and management tool</li>
<li>Mailing list management system</li>
<li>Facebook application</li>
<li>Online game</li>
<li>Online file management and sharing system</li>
</ul>
<h3>Paper Prototype</h3>
<p>Create a prototype using any number of analog tools, including: paper, pen/pencil, tape, scissors, cardboard, transparency sheets, dental floss or other.</p>

<td>Prototype was completed on time, shows multiple states and/or pages, uses handlebars for GUI widgets, incorporates basic interactivity like show/hide, or pop-up/overlay windows, incorporates advanced interactivity like sliders and multiple interactive elements (e.g. sliders with overlays and show/hide interactivity).</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Interactive Prototype</h3>
<p>Building upon the paper prototype you just created, make a revised version using Fireworks, Axure, PowerPoint, or another tool that lets you rapidly iterate through your ideas. Your  prototype should show interaction state, feedback messages, and simulate dynamic data display. Be sure to improve upon your previous prototype by addressing instructor and peer feedback in this iteration. Present your prototype to the class to receive feedback and share your experiences using the tools you selected.</p>

<td>Prototype was completed on time, shows multiple states and/or pages, incorporates  interactivity using Pages and States to show interactions like rollovers and pop-ups, and creatively uses advanced features to deliver a high fidelity outcome.</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>HTML Prototype</h3>
<p>Create an HTML  prototype of an application interface of your choice (see application interface suggestions). Discuss  your project concept with your instructor prior to beginning the assignment. Using HTML, CSS, and a JavaScript framework of your choice, create a prototype that simulates data storage, data retrieval, and other interaction patterns necessary for your application concept.</p>
<p>Do not focus on design aesthetics or branding, but ensure your prototype has a clear information hierarchy, is professional, and usable.</p>

<td>&nbsp;</td>

<h3>Review of Peer&#8217;s Prototype</h3>
<p>Critique your peer&#8217;s prototypes based on the design studio method outlined in the course. Critiques should provide 2&ndash;3 things you think are strong about the proposed design solution, 1&ndash;2 criticisms or things you think should either be improved, aren&#8217;t clear in the prototype, or clearly missed the stated audience and intent of the prototype. Critiques should focus on the form and function of the prototype more than the actual visual aesthetics of the prototype.</p>

<td>Critique was conducted on time, includes 2&ndash;3 positives and 1&ndash;2 criticisms, but critiques and suggestions are focused on non-solution elements (e.g. visual aesthetics, aspects that should be addressed through visual design instead of form and function) instead of the actual design solution.</td>
<td>Critique was conducted on time, includes at least 2&ndash;3 positives and 1&ndash;2 criticisms, critique is focused exclusively on the design solution, critique provides real recommendations for improvement. </td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h3>Prototype Usability Test</h3>
<p>Create and conduct a usability test of your prototype. Using the templates at <a href="http://usability.gov/templates/index.html">http://usability.gov/templates/</a> as a starting point, create a test screener, and a test plan. Identify five users for your test. Carry out the test, then prepare a usability report outlining the results and identifying recommendations  for improving the prototype. Adjust your prototype accordingly and submit it along with the testing instruments and report.</p>

<h3>Design Patterns 2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Students will create a design pattern library for the LP Paper Homepage Design.</li>
    <li>Students will 'break apart' the design for a Front-End Engineer.</li>
    <li>The design patterns should be saved in four sections (heading, navigation, content, and footer)</li>
    <li>Each section should have each image separated and labeled. For example, if the navigation items have a background image or color it should be presented and labeled "Main navigation bg'.</li>
    <li>See <a title="Yahoo! Design Pattern Stencil Library" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/wireframes/">Yahoo! Design Pattern Stencil Library</a> as another example of final product and feel free to use.</li>
    <li>File(s) should be saved in native format for ease of use by Front-End Engineer.</li>

<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Students will create an account at <a title="http://patterntap.com" href="http://patterntap.com/">http://patterntap.com</a>.</li>
    <li>Students will then create a user set for a design pattern of choice (ie: bold fonts, paper backgrounds, small font). The design pattern should be unique.</li>
    <li>Students will share their user set with others 2 other students in class.</li>

<h3>Typography Case Study</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Students will study 4 fonts by conducting a typography study of each in order to pick a base font for the upcoming wireframe in Assignment 11.</li>
    <li>Each font should be on a separate sheet (paper dimensions determined by professor)</li>
    <li>Each study will
    <ul>
      <li>clearly show the font name</li>
      <li>show the alphabet in two sizes</li>
      <li>each size with a capitalized version and a lowercase version</li>
      <li>modifications of the base font (ie: italic, bold) in a single word or letter</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>Other considerations
    <ul>
      <li>type direction (vertical, diagonal, etc) </li>
      <li>type orientation (upside down, upright, etc) </li>
      <li>color</li>
    </ul></li>
    <li>The result should be an aesthetically pleasing poster.</li>

<h3>Design Patterns 2</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Students will create a design pattern library for the LP Paper Homepage Design.</li>
    <li>Students will 'break apart' the design for a Front-End Engineer.</li>
    <li>The design patterns should be saved in four sections (heading, navigation, content, and footer)</li>
    <li>Each section should have each image separated and labeled. For example, if the navigation items have a background image or color it should be presented and labeled "Main navigation bg'.</li>
    <li>See <a title="Yahoo! Design Pattern Stencil Library" href="http://developer.yahoo.com/ypatterns/wireframes/">Yahoo! Design Pattern Stencil Library</a> as another example of final product and feel free to use.</li>
    <li>File(s) should be saved in native format for ease of use by Front-End Engineer.</li>

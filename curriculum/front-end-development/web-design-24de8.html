<h3><a name="css_zen_garden" id="css_zen_garden">Assignment: CSS Zen Garden</a></h3>

<p>Acquaint yourself with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Zen_Garden">history of Dave Shea's CSS Zen Garden project</a>, and browse the <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/zengarden/alldesigns/">archive of successful submissions</a>.</p>

<p>Using the <a href="http://csszengarden.com/zengarden-sample.html">example (X)HTML provided</a>, create a unique layout and page design for this page using only CSS. <strong>Do not modify the (X)HTML at all</strong>. All of your design modifications should come from your CSS document. Use <a href="http://www.stuffandnonsense.co.uk/archives/3d_css_zen_garden.html">Andy Clarke's 3D diagram of the CSS Zen Garden document markup</a> to get your bearings before starting your CSS.</p>

<p>Identify your design concept before getting started. Avoid replicating concepts that have already been created. Be creative! If you find yourself creatively stumped, consult Phillip Megg's book <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ylk2co">A History of Graphic Design</a> (Meggs, Philip. 3rd edition. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1998.), to gain inspiration from the masters. It is advisable to start with preliminary sketches on paper to identify the organization and positioning your design will follow.</p>

<p>You may use local style sheets during the design process, but they should be externalized once the design is complete. <strong>You are not allowed to begin with the example CSS file</strong>. You may consult it, but you must build your CSS from scratch. A word of advice, keep the style rules as simple as possible. Often students will create odd combinations of negative margins, absolute positioning and padding to nudge things around the page. More often than not, the same results can be had using only positioning. When things get too complex, scrap the style rule and start fresh. You will end up with the answer faster and with cleaner code.</p>

<p>Dave Shea's book <a href="http://tinyurl.com/6lz6pa">The Zen of CSS Design: Visual Enlightenment for the Web</a> (Shea, Dave. 3rd edition. Berkeley, CA: Peachpit Press, 2005.) unveils the techniques behind some of the most popular CSS Zen Garden designs. It may be a useful reference for this assignment.</p>

<h3><a name="site_redesign" id="site_redesign">Website Redesign</a></h3>

<p>Identify a website with at least 10 pages that does not follow web standards best practices then redesign and rebuild it.</p>

<p>Your website redesign should:</p>
 
<ul>
<li>Have valid (X)HTML that passes the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C's validation</a> tests. Validation errors caused by the use of emerging standards (example: RDFa) are acceptable</li>
<li>Have valid CSS that passes the <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">W3C's validation</a> tests. Validation errors caused by the use of emerging standards (example: SVG CSS properties) are acceptable</li>
<li>Use semantically meaningful markup and CSS</li>
<li>Employ general element selectors, class selectors, id selectors, contextual selectors, attribute selectors, selector grouping, child selectors, adjacent sibling selectors, and general sibling selectors</li>
<li>Employ floating or positioning schemas to layout the pages (no tables for layout)</li>
<li>Use an external stylesheet to style the entire site</li>
<li>Render consistently (within reason) across the four most popular web browsers</li>
<li>Employ image replacement techniques or Web Fonts</li>
<li>Consider the business and communication objectives of the organization, and present the content in a manner that is consistent with these goals</li>

<ul>
<li>Your school's website</li>

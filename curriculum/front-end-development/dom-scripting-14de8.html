<p>
  There are 8 assignments plus a final assignment. Assignment 1 is a general assignment writing a 
  course blog to track ones learning. Assignments 2-5 are preliminary in nature and intended to be 
  run within a console, e.g. in Firebug or the JavaScript shell. If run in a browser window, it is 
  allowed to use the 
  <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/En/DOM:window.prompt">window.prompt</a> and 
  <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/window.alert">window.alert</a> methods for input and output.
</p>
<h3>Assignment 1: Course Blog</h3>
<p>
  Setup a blog using <a href="http://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a>, <a href="http://www.blogger.com/">Blogger</a>, or another comparable system. 
  Each week of the course, write one blog post that expands upon the topics discussed in class or readings. Each post 
  should be at least 200 words in length, and should contain images and links where appropriate.
</p>
<p>
  <strong>Recommended:</strong> Subscribe to your classmates' blog <acronym>RSS</acronym> 
  feeds using <a href="http://www.google.com/reader/">Google Reader</a>, <a href="http://www.netvibes.com/">Netvibes</a>, <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/">Bloglines</a>, 
  or another <acronym>RSS</acronym> reader of your choice so you can learn from your peers.

<p>B. Construct a loop that will read data from the user and then evaluates the data and alert
the user about its type, etc. Numbers should be checked if they are within an acceptable range.
Strings should be checked if they are of an appropriate length. User data that contains a
vertical bar should be <a href="http://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/String/split">split</a>
into arrays. These in turn should be checked and must not contain fewer than 3 or more than 5 parts.

<h3>Assignment 4: Regular expressions</h3>
<p>
Use RegexpBuddy or a similar tool (Regextester, Regexp Coach, etc) and construct 
regular expressions that matches:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A zip-code</li>
  <li>An e-mail address (basic testing is OK, since the formal rules are really hard to put into regular expressions)</li>
  <li>An <acronym>URI</acronym> where the protocol is http</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Then read data from the user at least ten times and test which of the above (if any) it matches. Output the results.
  (The teacher should use test strings that should either match or fail to match the expressions, when
  evaluating the students work. A test harness can be used. The teacher may also suggest other things that
  the regular expressions should match.)

<h3>Assignment 5: Time and Math</h3>
<p>
  A. Implement functions to handle at least two of the following mathematical tasks:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Read a number from the user and convert it from Fahrenheit to Centigrade.</li>
  <li>
    Generate at least five random numbers, perform a calculus or trigonometric function on each.
    Output the result like this: &#8220;The square of <em>n</em> is <em>result</em>. Use appropriate rounding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Calculate the sum of at least five well known mathematical or physical numbers/constants.
    Use appropriate rounding.
  </li>
  <li>Calculate the square sum of at least ten arbitrary numbers.</li>

  D. Make a simple real time clock. Combine this assignment with assignment 7: Styling, 
  <acronym>DOM</acronym> manipulation and animation.
</p>

<h3>Assignment 6: Algorithms</h3>
<p>Implement a pair of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_algorithms">common algorithms</a>
  or solve a common puzzle using ECMAScript (e.g. the Tower of Hanoi, bubble sort, Fibonacci numbers).</p>

<p><a href="http://projecteuler.net/">Project Euler</a> can be used as inspiration.</p>

<p>Easier algorithms might be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Finding the nth Fibonacci number.</li>
  <li>Finding the largest prime number of a composite number.</li>
  <li>A simple shifted cryptographic algoritm, e.g. A = C, B = D, C = E, etc.</li>
  <li>Pythagoras theorem: Finding the length of the third side.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Harder algorithms might be:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Bubble sort</li>
  <li>The Tower of Hanoi</li>
  <li>Splitting a composite number into primes.</li>
  <li>Eulers algorithm</li>
  <li>Calculating a trigonometric value (sin, cos, tan) without the use of the Math object.</li>

<h3>Assignment 7: Styling, DOM manipulation and animation</h3>
<p>Implement all of the following:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Make an element on a web page that changes background according to a user switch, changing the style value.</li>
  <li>Make an identical page, but this time toggle the background through changing class-names.</li>
  <li>(Combined with assignment 5C): Make a real time clock that updates every second.</li>
  <li>Use timed events to make some animated effects, e.g. fade in and out, expansion/contraction, sliding in/out.</li>
  <li>Use a library of choice and implement an accordion widget.</li>
</ol>
<p>The teacher may add alternative tasks.</p>
<h3>Assignment 8: Forms</h3>
<p>
  Construct a page containing a form containing radio buttons, check boxes and at least 
  one text input element, option element and submit button.
  Implement the following:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    At least 2 additional widgets, besides those available in <acronym>HTML</acronym> 4. E.g. a slider or a date picker.
    The use of a library is allowed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Widgets that are hidden until needed, i.e. when the presence of a widget is logically 
    dependent upon the the value in another field it should reflect that logic.
  </li>
  <li>Adding fields using an &#8220;add row&#8221; button.</li>
  <li>On submit validation and usable feedback.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Final assignment</h3>
<p>
  Build a web page that is using <acronym>DOM</acronym> Scripting to achieve several effects.
</p>
<p>
  Example page/effects:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>A simple game or quiz</li>
  <li>A slide show (self built)</li>
  <li>A calculator</li>
  <li>A status or game score ticker (using Ajax)</li>
  <li>A calendar</li>
  <li>A sortable or filterable table with hide and show functionality of individual columns or rows and automatic recalculation</li>
  <li>A <acronym>DHTML</acronym> menu</li>
  <li>An analog clock, using <acronym>SVG</acronym></li>
  <li>A text area in <acronym>HTML</acronym> and a live preview area next to it, that will update in real time as the user types into the text area.</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  Present your result both in an easily readable format and in a minified version.

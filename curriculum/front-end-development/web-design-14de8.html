<h4>Assignment 1: Class Homepage</h4>

<p>Students will create a single web page. The purpose of the page is to serve as the student&#039;s home page for the class. The student can create a personal profile with information about him or herself. As the class proceeds, links to the student&#039;s future assignments will be added to this home page. The document must demonstrate proper semantic structure in the use of elements. The page must demonstrate the correct use of some or all of the following items: DOCTYPE, html, head, title, body, p, blockquote, br, div, span, strong, em, acronym, abbr, ul, li, ol, dl, dt, dd, img, table, caption, summary, thead, tfoot, tbody, tr, td, comment. Students must demonstrate that the page validates according to the DOCTYPE chosen.</p>

<h4>Assignment 3: Web site</h4>
<p>Create a complete Web site of several pages.

The layout must be <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> based using an external stylesheet. The styled content must demonstrate mastery of <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> properties including background, border, clear, color, float, font, height, line-height, list-style, margin, overflow, padding, position, text-align, text-indent, and width. The site should demonstrate mastery of concepts regarding DOCTYPE and semantic <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> markup. The <abbr title="Cascading Style Sheets">CSS</abbr> must demonstrate an understanding of the Cascade and inheritance and make use of descendant selectors to minimize the number of classes. The content should include an accessible form with a functioning script to test submission. (See the resources list for a script for the form work.)</p>

<h4>Lab Assignments</h4>
<p>A number of hands-on lab assignments are suggested throughout the course. They include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a basic web page with brief text, save to student folder, and display it in a browser</li>
<li>Use <abbr title="File Transfer Protocol">FTP</abbr> software to transfer web page to server. Discuss site structure on the server, put and get, setting up accounts for remote servers</li>
<li>Create a transparent image, and optimized images in multiple formats</li>
<li>Create a practice page with numerous links</li>
<li>Add at least one list to a web page</li>
<li>Define and give examples of a relative path and an absolute path</li>
<li>Diagram and label the box model</li>
<li>Build an accessible practice table</li>

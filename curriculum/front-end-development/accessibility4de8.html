<h3><a id="aw" name="aw"></a>Awareness Lab</h3>

<p>In your experience visiting web sites at one time or another you've probably encountered a web page that is difficult or frustrating to use. You also may have noticed web pages with accessibility issues. In this activity you will describe a web page that is either difficult to use of has one or more of the accessibility issues described in the <a href="http://www.washington.edu/doit/Video/www.html">World Wide Access: Accessible Web Design video</a>. Write a one or two paragraphs that include the URL of the web page, the goal of the web site, the target audience of the web site, and three to five sentences about the accessibility and/or usability issues of the page.</p>

<h3><a id="sl" name="sl"></a>Simulation Lab</h3>

<p>Complete one of the simulations listed below. Take notes about your experiences during the simulation because you will be writing a few paragraphs about your experiences. Also identify ways that the design of the site could be improved to create a better experience for all users.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>WebAim Screen Reader Simulation</strong>
<p>Can you complete the tasks using the screen reader? If you need a hint or two, "i" will give you a peek at the web page screen shot. Don't be surprised if you get a little frustrated during this simulation &mdash; think of how it would be to always access the Web in this manner!</p>
<p><a href="http://www.webaim.org/simulations/screenreader">http://www.webaim.org/simulations/screenreader</a></p>
<p>OR</p></li>
<li><strong>Low Vision Simulation</strong>

<p>OR</p></li>
<li><strong>Mobility Impairment Simulation</strong>
<p>In this simulation you will gain an understanding of limitations of computer use for people with limited use of their hands. Some people must rely on a mouthstick or a single finger for computer input.</p>
<ol><li>Choose a web site to try out.</li>
<li>Place your mouse where you cannot reach it.</li>
<li>Use one finger on the the keyboard to navigate a web site. Use the tab, page up, page down, and enter keys.</li></ol></li>
</ul>

<h4>For all simulations:</h4>

<p>Include the following information in your report.</p>

<ul>
<li>List the simulation option you completed.</li>
<li>If you completed the Mobility Impairment Simulation, copy and paste the URL of the web site you visited.</li>
<li>Write a few paragraphs about your experiences using the simulation. Describe any surprises you encountered or frustrations that you felt.</li>
<li>Suggest three ways that the design of the web pages could be improved.</li>

<h3><a id="designlab" name="designlab"></a>Accessible Content Design and Test Lab</h3>

<p>Create a web page with accessible content and accessible navigation. Verify your skills when you test your page with an online accessibility testing tool.</p>

<h4>Create a Web Page</h4>

<p>Create a web page document about ONE of the following topics:</p>

<ul>
<li>accessibility</li>
<li>web design</li>
<li>a hobby</li>
<li>a vacation destination</li>
<li>your resume</li>
</ul>

<p>The page must include the following components:</p>

<ul>
<li>a navigation area with five hyperlinks</li>
<li>at least one paragraph</li>
<li>one h1 element</li>
<li>at least one h2 element</li>
<li>an unordered list</li>
<li>at least one image</li>
<li>The CSS page layout should be centered with two columns and take up no more than 80% of the browser window.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your document must use valid (X)HTML and CSS syntax. Publish your page to the Web.</p>

<h4>Test for Accessibility</h4>

<p>Choose ONE of the following accessibility testing tools to check your page:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://fae.cita.uiuc.edu/">Illinois Functional Accessibility Evaluator (FAE)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a></li>
<li><a href="http://worldspace.deque.com/">Worldspace Online</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Review the results and modify your page until you believe that you have satisfied the requirements. Add a reflection to your web page document that includes responses to the following questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>What is the name and URL of the testing tool you choose to use?</li>
<li>What accessibility guidelines does the tool follow?</li>
<li>Describe the modifications you needed to make to your page in order to pass the test.</li>
<li>Would you recommend using this tool to verify compliance with accessibility guidelines? Why or why not?</li>
</ol>

</ol>

<p>Read the replies of the other students and respond to at least two students by MM/DD with a substantial response that extends the discussion.</p>

<h4>Discussion Question 6</h4>

<h5>Accessibility Testing Mini-Review</h5>

<p>We are taking a very broad view of accessibility in this Discussion Question and considering a wide variety of testing tools/applications &mdash; not only applications that specifically test for Section 508 or W3C WCAG compliance. Choose ONE of the accessibility checkers, screen readers, text-browser simulators, reading level testers, or color blindness simulation tools introduced in the Accessibility Testing Module.</p>

<p>Reply to this message by MM/DD: Change the subject of your reply from &#8220;Accessibility Testing Application Mini-Review&#8221; to &#8220;your name &mdash; The Application Name&#8221; For example, &#8220;Poindexter - Hera 2.0&#8221;</p>

<p>Include the following in your message:</p>

<ol>
<li>The name of the application</li>
<li>The purpose of the application</li>
<li>Ease of download and installation (if applicable)</li>
<li>Cost (if applicable)</li>
<li>Ease of use</li>
<li>Type of report provided. As a starting point, consider any of the following &mdash; only use those that are applicable: text-based, graphic-based, code errors highlighted, line numbers of errors listed, simulation, and so on.</li>
<li>If applicable, indicate whether Section 508, WC3 WCAG 1.0 or W3C WCAG 2.0 standard compliance are reported on.</li>
<li>State your recommendation and justify it.</li>
</ol>

<p>NOTE: EACH STUDENT MUST REPORT ON A DIFFERENT TOOL &mdash; students who answer this Discussion Question earlier have more choices than students who answer this Discussion Question later.</p>

<p>Read the replies of the other students and respond by MM/DD with a comment that furthers the discussion by either making an observation and asking a question OR describing your own experiences with this application.</p>

<h4>Discussion Question 7</h4>

<h5>Reflecting on your Accessibility Journey</h5>

<p>You've jumped headfirst into web design accessibility topics in this course. Let's take a few moments in this DQ to reflect on your journey into accessibility. This DQ provides an opportunity for you to reflect and think about your exploration of web accessibility in this course.</p>

<p>Reply to this message MM/DD: Change the subject of your reply from &#8220;Reflecting on your Accessibility Journey&#8221; to &#8220;your name - your Aha! moment&#8221; (For example: &#8220;Beatrice - headings make a difference&#8221;)</p>

<p>Read the questions below. Spend a few minutes thinking about the questions and how you plan to answer the questions. In your message, answer EACH of the following questions with two to four sentences that provide examples/justification/etc. As you explored the topic of web accessibility&#8230;</p>

<ol>
<li>At what point did you feel most engaged with what was happening?</li>
<li>At what point did you feel most distanced from what was happening?</li>
<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took did you find most affirming and helpful?</li>
<li>What action that anyone (teacher or student) took did you find most puzzling or confusing?</li>
<li>What surprised you the most? (This could be something about your own reactions to what went on, or something that someone did, or anything else that occurs to you.)</li>
<li>Any additional thoughts?</li>
</ol>

<p>Read the other students' messages. Reply to at least two students with a constructive comment, suggestion, or question that furthers the discussion by MM/DD.</p>

<h4>Sample Discussion Question Rubric</h4>
This rubric could be used in an online course to evaluate student discussion question participation. Note: this is a generic rubric that could be used for any discussion question &mdash; therefore it does not correspond to a specific course content competency.

<h4>Discussion Question Participation Tips:</h4>

<p>A total of 12 points is available for each mandatory discussion question. It's a good idea to login to the course three times per week to keep up with the discussion.</p>

<ul>
<li>Participate EARLIER in the WEEK rather than at the last possible moment.</li>
<li>Reply to others EARLIER in the WEEK rather than at the last possible moment.</li>
<li>Check in and participate in the discussion three separate days per week.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your participation in the discussion question is assessed using the rubric shown below.</p>

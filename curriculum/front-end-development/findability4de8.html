<h3><a name="findability_website" id="findability_website">Assignment: Findability Website</a></h3>

<p>Throughout the course you have begun to develop portions of a website that presents content about the various topics we have explored in class. These smaller projects, our class discussions, and your research now will all combine to become a site about the various aspects of findability. Use the design created for your blog as the template for the rest of the pages. Below is a sitemap for the website you will be creating:</p>
 
<img src="/images/uploads/general/final-project-sitemap.png" width="556" height="202" alt="Findability final project sitemap" />

<p>Page Descriptions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>1.0 Home</strong>: Write keyword rich copy for the home page that sums up the content of this site. Define target keywords using <a href="https://adwords.google.com/select/KeywordToolExternal?defaultView=2">Google's keyword tool</a>  or <a href="http://wordtracker.com/">Wordtracker</a>. Identify keywords that people search for, but have relatively low competition. Use the markup techniques discussed in the course to create effective keyword density, and clear information hierarchy for search engines and users alike. Evaluate the keyword density of your pages using the online <a href="http://www.ranks.nl/cgi-bin/ranksnl/spider/spider.cgi?lang">Keyword density and prominence tool</a>. The design of your home page should clearly direct traffic to the key areas of the site.</li>
<li><strong>2.0 Findability Blog</strong>: Your research blog from the above assignment.</li>
<li><strong>3.0 SEO Best Practices</strong>: Summarize the techniques you have learned in the class and in your own research to create a findable website.</li>
<li><strong>4.0 Research Topic</strong>: Convert your research presentation into a web page using the same template design as is used in the rest of the site.</li>
<li><strong>5.0 Findability Resources</strong>: Create a page with links to valuable findability resources. Split the links into the following categories: SEO, email marketing, search, traffic analysis, my classmates (links to each student's blog). You should have at least 20 resource links in addition to the classmate links.</li>
<li><strong>6.0 Findability Vocabulary</strong>: Create a page using definition lists to create a findability vocabulary reference page. Include at least 10 definitions.</li>
<li><strong>7.0 About This Site</strong>: Create a page that describes how your site was built to improve findability, what strategies you used to register it with search engines, how you built inbound links, how you'll analyze your traffic to discover findability problems, and generally how you are directing traffic to the site. Include on this page the evaluation methods you used to assess your success.</li>
<li><strong>8.0 Contact</strong>: Create a contact page that presents your contact info in the hCard microformat. Include a link to download the information.</li>
<li><strong>9.0 Sitemap</strong>: Create a sitemap linking to all pages in the site facilitating better usability and search engine indexing of your pages.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your site should also have the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>sitemap.xml</strong> registered with Google, Yahoo, MSN Live, and Ask (link to it in the sitemap page so the instructor can evaluate it)</li>
<li><strong>robots.txt</strong> preventing certain content form being indexed, and directing search engines to your sitemap.xml file</li>
<li><strong>Google Analytics</strong> tracking</li>
<li>Semantic, accessible markup that employs the recommendations of Chapter 2: Markup Strategies from the first recommended course text</li>
<li>An integrated search tool with **OpenSearch** implemented so users can search without visiting your site</li>
<li>Use image replacement techniques to ensure the logo, though graphical, is presented with clear markup hierarchy</li>
<li>Creative commons licensing</li>
<li>A custom 404 page that helps lost users get back on track</li>
</ul>

<p>Your site should use valid (X)HTML and CSS. For accessibility, validate your site to WCAG 1.0 single A with <a href="http://www.tawdis.net/taw3/cms/en">TAWDIS</a>, or Section 508 Priority 1 with <a href="http://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE</a>, depending on what is more suitable for your situation (). Place validation links in the footer of each page. Use <a href="http://raven-seo-tools.com/">Raven's SEO tools</a> to evaluate your web site's SEO success before submitting the assignment.</p>

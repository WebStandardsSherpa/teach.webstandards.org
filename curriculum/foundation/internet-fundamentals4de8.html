<h3>Timeline</h3>

<p>Draw (or develop using Digital Design Tools) a timeline for the history of the Internet citing important dates, events, and people. For each date cited include at least one image, the date, event name, and a summary of the event. You should begin with events and people that lead to the creation of the Internet, not with the creation itself. There are no limitations in size or methods used. Be creative and make it visually appealing.</p>

<h3>News Aggregation</h3>
<p>Using an aggregation tool of choice (Google Reader, Netvibes, etc) collect and sort feeds in the following categories:</p>
<ul>

<h3>Blog</h3>

<p>Write and post a 250-word synopsis about anything relevant to design, art, web development each week to your Wordpress blog. Include images that support your blog entry.</p>

<p>Use this as an opportunity to write about topics in design, art, and development that interest you. This is a chance to differentiate your blog from your classmates&#8217; blogs. It is also an opportunity to develop a positive, professional online image and personal voice. Make sure that the posts are professional. They may be funny. They may be informal. But they should not be overtly offensive. Basically, make sure they help in your career planning and do not overly offend potential employers.</p>

<p>A new blog entry is due posted to your blog, each week. Each entry must be posted before the beginning of class in order to receive credit for completing the assignment. All posts must be completed in order to pass the course. Blog entries that are posted late will earn a zero and will be factored into your blog grade.</p>

<p>Categorize each blog post for this course with the following tag the course tag. I will not proofread your entries before you post them so make sure that you have proofread them, have a friend proof them, and/or go to the writing center to get feedback.</p>

<p>As always, cite all sources to information and images used in your posts that are not your original idea.</p>

<p>Read the following articles about writing well for the Web:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/writebetter">How to Write a Better Weblog</a>&#8221; by Dennis A. Mahoney</li>
<li>&#8220;<a href="http://blueflavor.com/blog/2008/may/28/learning-how-write-web/">Learning How to Write For The Web</a>&#8221; by Tiffani Jones</li>
</ul>

<p>Suggested books to improve your writing:</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8220;Eats, Shoots &amp; Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation&#8221; by Lynne Truss</li>
<li>&#8220;Woe Is I: The Grammarphobe&#8217;s Guide to Better English in Plain English&#8221; by Patricia T. O&#8217;Connor</li>

<h3>Life Goal Plan</h3>

<p>There are many directions your career life may take you. The purpose of this assignment is to explore 3 different career tracks that you may take.</p>

<p>Think about what personal and professional steps you must take to reach your career goals. Break these steps down by year. For example: what are you doing now to help you reach your goals? What do you have to accomplish next year, in 3 years, in 5 years&#8230; to be where you want to be in your career in 15 years.</p>

<p>Yes, your career goals will likely change in the next 15 years and so will the steps that you will have to take in order to reach your goals. However, this assignment will help you to determine what type of career tracks you are interested in pursuing, as well as, what actions are needed to be successful in your endeavors.</p>

<p>Choose 3 career tracks and create a chart that shows what steps you need to take for each career track for the following years: 15 years, 10 years, 5 years, 3 years, 1 years, Now.</p>

</p><h4>Goals</h4>
<p>Students learn how to develop a project timeline and allocate project resources using either the traditional or agile methodology.</p>
<p>Students can determine feasibility of each, and explain which one they would choose for a particular project.</p>
<h4>Traditional method</h4>
<ol><li>Determine project phases (analysis, design, etc), tasks (brainstorm, concept, design, development) and outputs (wireframes, design mock-ups etc) that have to be done in each.</li>
<li>Work with team members to estimate the amount of work each tasks will take. Note any assumptions or constraints. Assign resource to each task.</li>
<li>Draw up a Gantt chart, a network diagram or timeline. You may use a project management tool to generate this.</li>
<li>Identify internal and external dependencies, and any critical paths and near-critical paths.</li>
<li>Identify key milestones, including required meetings: client reviews, client hand-offs</li>
<li>Briefly describe how the timeline, and therefore the project would be affected if a client is late with one of their deliverables (e.g. providing copy)</li></ol>
<h4>Bonus points:</h4>
<ul><li>Identify internal deliverables of tasks on the timeline</li>
<li>Briefly describe what kind of projects is best suited to waterfall (and why), and when it is necessarily to adapt the simple waterfall model for a more iterative development.</li></ul>

<p>Notes on rubrics: The main form of assessment is not that there is necessarily a right/wrong answer, more that the student understands the decisions they have made. Real projects sometimes require creative solutions, it&#8217;s more important that the student grasps the consequences project decisions rather than follow a rote waterfall model.</p>
<h4>Agile method</h4>
<ol><li>From the RFP, write a set of main user stories. Document any justifications, assumptions or constraints.</li>
<li>Work with team members to estimate story points and an initial velocity. Document any assumptions on estimations. Assign resource to each story. If you cannot assign a resource, explain why.</li>

<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Chinese whispers/telephone</p>
<p><strong>Section:</strong> Project Management</p>
<p><strong>Phase:</strong> Initiation, Completion</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> Group roleplay/activity</p>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>The chinese whispers/telephone game is a great method to illustrate how easily communication can breakdown and how costly the effects can be. The exercise will also cover  as well as the importance of buy-in and documenting decisions and changes made during the course of the project. Through the exercise, students will be exposed to and practice principles of change management.</p>
<h4>Goals</h4>
<ul><li>Students understand the difference between authoritative information and rumour and how to distinguish between them.</li>
<li>Students are reminded first-hand how communication can easily be misinterpreted through multiple parties. </li>
<li>Students learn to anticipate and plan for change and build adaptive courses of action based on anticipated changes.</li>
<li>Students practice listening and communication skills.</li>
<li>Students learn through interaction and a fun activity.</li>
<li>Students create connections with each other through activity and a common goal.</li>
<li>Students begin to feel a sense of community with each other.</li></ul>

<h4>Practice</h4>
<p><strong>1. Standard.</strong> Instructor gives first student three critical things to remember about the project. Student passes it on.</p>
<p><strong>2. Enhanced.</strong> Instructor gives first student three critical things to remember about the project. Student passes it on. Instructor adds an additional 2 somewhere down the line (analogous to client wanting to add to project requirements or addition from major stakeholders). Students have to remember the original 3, plus the additional new two.</p>
<p><strong>3. Advanced.</strong> Instructor gives first student three critical things to remember about the project. student passes it on. Instructor changes 1-2 of original 3 and also adds an additional 2 somewhere down the line (analogous to client wanting to add to project requirements or addition from major stakeholders). Students have to remember and accurately relay all information.</p>
<p><strong>4. Last person has to report their message.</strong> However, in addition, all participants must discuss the last message and determine where the change happens. Once the original message is figured out, then the request needs to be either agreed upon, or negotiated and then documented.</p>
<p><strong>5. Group discussion</strong> Students share their experience in the game and also from professional experience. Students troubleshoot the process of the game see how they can improve it. Instructor makes parallels to actual PM situations.</p>

<h3 id="handoff">Handoff, Review &amp; Acceptance</h3>

<p><strong>Assignment:</strong> Handoff, Review &amp; Acceptance</p>
<p><strong>Section:</strong> Client Management</p>
<p><strong>Phase:</strong> Implementation</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> Created document (to be seen by &#8220;client&#8221;)</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>

<p>Your team has completed a major milestone and there is a deliverable to the client. However, timely feedback on this deliverable is critical for the continuation of the project and the subsequent deliverables are dependent upon it. You need to communicate all of this information to the client in order to get them to act within the desired timeframe.</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<ul>
<li>Clearly communicate the necessity of deliverable and its importance in the grand scheme of the project, particularly where it&#8217;s a dependency of other tasks or project payment.</li>
<li>Differentiate between &#8220;handoff for review&#8221; and &#8220;handoff for Acceptance&#8221;.</li>
<li>Establish clear objectives for the client.</li>
<li>Establish clear time constraints for the client and what happens if they&#8217;re not met. </li>
</ul>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<ol>
<li>Write up a handoff memo to give a client an important deliverable that they need to review and give feedback on in a limited period of time. Make the time constraints and the consequences of deviating from them explicit.</li>
<li>Clearly explain deliverable, its content, relevance to the project, and location/how to access it</li>
<li>Clearly communicate the action items with the deliverable, as well as their need and their dependencies on upcoming tasks. Make repercussions for not achieving the action items very clear. For example, one approach is that if comments not returned by agreed date, deliverable is deemed Accepted.</li>
<li>Present/reiterate acceptance criteria (determined during the project kickoff)</li>
<li>Define the feedback mechanism (e.g. document template, review site, commenting in document, etc.) and how any comments are adopted into rework</li>
<li>Reiterate project timeline</li>
<li>Outline the next steps for the project, as well as responsibilities for upcoming tasks.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section:</strong> Client Management</p>
<p><strong>Phase:</strong> All</p>
<p><strong>Type:</strong> Created document (to be seen by &#8220;client&#8221;, and manager)</p>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>Project managers need to provide weekly progress reports to clients/managers (the instructor) to summarize the work of the group for the week.</p>

<h4>Goals</h4>

<ul>
<li>Communicate effectively and consistently with all project members, both internal and external</li>
<li>Demonstrate continual project assessment</li>
<li>Demonstrate continual personal and team assessment</li>
</ul>

<h4>Readings</h4>

<h4>Optional Resource</h4>

<p><a href="http://teach.webstandards.org/images/uploads/documents/generic_1page_project_report.pdf">Project report template</a></p>

<h4>Practice</h4>

<p>In the form of a blog post write up a brief account of the project. This should include:</p>

<ol>
<li>tasks for the current week and what was accomplished</li>
<li>tasks and goals for the upcoming week with baseline &amp; forecast dates</li>
</ol>

<p>Your assessment should include:</p>

<ul>
<li>Summary Status: 1-2 brief paragraphs.This is your elevator pitch of the week and may be the message that gets more widely communicated.</li>
<li>Milestones hit/log of milestones, with baseline date, plus actual or forecast date as appropriate.</li>
<li>Current Risk Log, with weighting</li>
<li>Current Action Log - this is where you ask for help from your stakeholders &amp; hold them to account to deliver. Be sure to indicate due date &amp; who is accountable for each action</li>
<li>Any changes in the project scope and/or schedule and/or Quality and/or cost, and notation of any formal change requests &amp; their status</li>
<li>Any client requests, meetings and decisions made.</li></ul>
<p>A further self-assessment needs to be done with regard to the assignments, especially the interactive ones, and what each student feels they learned from the assignment and how the assignment could have been more valuable for them.</p>

        <p>I am a marketing communications professional/former Web designer/Web content manager who has created and redesigned a number of sites for Fortune companies and small business alike. However, I&#8217;ve paid little to no attention to Web standards. Now I realize that to compete, I need to learn these standards and learn them well.</p>

<p>I was laid off from my last Fortune 100 position (along with thousands of others, when our jobs went to India). So, I have some time to devote to improving my skill set. Learning Web standards is my top priority. However, I don&#8217;t have money to pay for classes (or at least that is not where I should be spending money, now). While I look for work, I would like to strengthen my value to whomever might hire me. The Interact series of courses seems ideally suited to my help with this goal. I&#8217;d like to hear from forum members: <b><i>do you believe this set of courses can be self guided or completed via independent learning?</i></b> And, if so, where would you suggest seeking support with independent learning? Also, is there any certification for completing these courses independently?</p>

<p>Thanks!

        <p>My web standards article course - the Opera web standards curriculum - is referenced in many areas of the Interact curriculum, and is also available in it&#8217;s entirety at <a href="http://www.opera.com/wsc">http://www.opera.com/wsc</a>.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m aiming to provide a complete set of teaching articles to learn all the basics of front end development from, and I&#8217;ve already got a lot of feedback, but I&#8217;d love more - please check it out and let me know if you think it is missing anything, and what else you&#8217;d like to see covered.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m planning on including follow on courses on topics such as mobile web development, SVG, HTML 5 and CSS 3. These will start to appear later on in the year.

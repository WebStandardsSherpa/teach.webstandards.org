      <title>Is there support for independent learning&#63;</title>
      <link>http://teach.webstandards.org/forums/viewthread/27/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am a marketing communications professional/former Web designer/Web content manager who has created and redesigned a number of sites for Fortune companies and small business alike. However, I&#8217;ve paid little to no attention to Web standards. Now I realize that to compete, I need to learn these standards and learn them well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was laid off from my last Fortune 100 position (along with thousands of others, when our jobs went to India). So, I have some time to devote to improving my skill set. Learning Web standards is my top priority. However, I don&#8217;t have money to pay for classes (or at least that is not where I should be spending money, now). While I look for work, I would like to strengthen my value to whomever might hire me. The Interact series of courses seems ideally suited to my help with this goal. I&#8217;d like to hear from forum members: &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;do you believe this set of courses can be self guided or completed via independent learning?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; And, if so, where would you suggest seeking support with independent learning? Also, is there any certification for completing these courses independently?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks!

      <title>Opera web standards curriculum feedback please!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;My web standards article course &#45; the Opera web standards curriculum &#45; is referenced in many areas of the Interact curriculum, and is also available in it&#8217;s entirety at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.opera.com/wsc&quot;&gt;http://www.opera.com/wsc&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m aiming to provide a complete set of teaching articles to learn all the basics of front end development from, and I&#8217;ve already got a lot of feedback, but I&#8217;d love more &#45; please check it out and let me know if you think it is missing anything, and what else you&#8217;d like to see covered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m planning on including follow on courses on topics such as mobile web development, SVG, HTML 5 and CSS 3. These will start to appear later on in the year.
